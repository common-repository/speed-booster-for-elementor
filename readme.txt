You might be thinking about Elementor's claim of not loading any assets on pages not built on Elementor. It's true. But lots of other Elementor Addons that you are using are loading their assets (.CSS and .JS files, queries, addons, etc) on every page of your site - which slows down your WordPress website. This sluggish loading time hurts your Core Web Vitals score and eventually affects overall conversion.

Instead, with the help of Elementor Speed Optimizer speed up your site and improve Core Web vital score significantly. Take the visitor‚Äôs user experience to the next level without additional cost and using any cache or minify plugin.
